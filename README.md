Hi, so I wanted to make a project for my resume to make it stronger and I thought what better than to make a leetcode problem technical interview simulator using the Gemini API? 
Doing this project is great, as its not just a one and done thing, I can use this on my own leetcode journey further building my skills as a software dev. 
It taught me a lot since Im using a new framework in React, and a whole new language in JS, and tailwind CSS. 
So how this works, is that its essentially an ai wrapper right now but I want to add features where users can make accounts, have the chat history be saved and add future inputs such as diagrams and voice. 
Right now we are able to input a leetcode style problem, inputs its solution, and then Gemini would act as a interviewer, asking the user to explain their thought process in the coding problem, just like a technical.
